# createDataset
This code is used to download images for creating a dataset using microsoft bing image search API
I havent set the code to accept arguments on command prompt so you have to manually change the search term in the code for your preference. It is currently set as barack obama to download images of barrack obama. You would also need to change the output directory on your local machine where you would want your images to be downloaded.
